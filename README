Tokyo-cabinet4r
==================

Tokyo cabinet hash plugin for Rails.
Subclassing TokyoCabinet4r allows the easy creation and usage of some Tokyo Cabinet functionalieties.
- Tokyo Cabinet B+ tree (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree)
- Tokyo Cabinet table database API (arbitrary columns, usual key-value stores)
(see http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/index.html for more, but not implemented yet)

Install
========
Prerequisites:
Install Tokyo Cabinet (source available at http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/index.html).
Install Tokyo Cabinet Ruby bindings (http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/rubypkg/ - doc http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/rubydoc/).
(had to use build options --with-tokyocabinet-include= --with-tokyocabinet-lib= pointing to the source directory of tokyocabinet)

install as a plugin for Rails.  Tested with Rails 2.3.2

Example
=======
Btree:
use generator
script/generate tc_bdb phone_number

this creates a subclass of TokyoCabinet4r::BDB, which can be used in rails.  The db file is created in
RAILS_ROOT/db/tokyo/RAILS_ENV/
and has the underscored name of the given class.

Table:
use generator
script/generate tc_tdb shortest_path


Why i developed this (example of use): for scalable shortest path calculation.


Todo
=====

* more elegant handling of opening and closing of file, without resorting to too much metaprogramming.
* investigate use of Tokyo Tyrant.
* transactions
* cursors
* implement other tokyo database structures (if demand)
